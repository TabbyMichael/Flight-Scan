###Hi Dev,###


##Instructions##

Using the 'json-files' folder, see if you can develop a mobile application(Dart/Flutter) utilizing the four json files. 
NB: The 'flights.json is the primary endpoint which is the response from the POST REQUEST below :
{ 
    "user_id": "dev_api", 
    "user_password": "**********", 
    "access": "Test", 
    "ip_address": "**.**.**.225", 
    "requiredCurrency": "USD", 
    "journeyType": "OneWay", 
    "OriginDestinationInfo": 
        [
            { "departureDate": "2025-12-21", "airportOriginCode": "AMS", "airportDestinationCode": "LON" }
        ], 
    "class": "Economy", 
    "adults": 2, 
    "childs": 1, 
    "infants": 1 
}' 
####hint####
The other '.json' are there to help you find more details about each flight. 

## Main Assesment criteria: ##
Filter Functionality (Further filter the flights.json).
A flight detail page. (eg With even the Flight logo)
Look and feel of the application(attention to detail).
Functionality of the application
Code understanding (we might introduce a bug which you try and fix);

## Bonus assesment ##
Creativity & Thought process
Security of the application
Data Persistence
